# Dorado — Product Requirements Document

## Concept

Dorado is a social-media-style platform that connects investors with founders who are building startups and need funding.

## Problem

Investors and founders have fragmented discovery and outreach workflows. Investors spend too long filtering opportunities, while founders struggle to get in front of the right investors quickly.

## Solution

Provide two role-based experiences (Investor and Founder) with shared startup discovery, AI-generated startup summaries, and meeting scheduling links to speed up matching and first conversations.

## Target Users

- **Primary:** Investors (angels, VCs, syndicates) looking for startups.
- **Secondary:** Founders seeking funding and investor exposure.

## Navigation and Views

The app supports two views:

1. **Investor View**
2. **Founder View**

Shared left sidebar navigation:

- Dashboard
- Network
- Search
- Portfolio (Investor) / Profile (Founder)
- Upcoming Meetings (Calendly integration)

## Pages and Requirements

Dashboard should include:

- Startup matches
- Schedule/Meetings module (Calendly API)
- Quick Actions

### 2. Search

Search supports filtering by:

- Team Size
- Location
- Industry
- Stage of Development
- Total Raised

Additional search behavior:
